# 1. Description of the portfolio website


## A. Purpose

Blinking cursor is a personal website that hosts my coding and web development works. The prototype was built by me only using HTML & CSS from scratch within a timeframe of approximately one week as part of an assignment task given by 2019 Coder Academy Melbourne Gentech bootcamp.

Although the initial purpose of creating this site is largely for learning purpose only, I picture myself, in the future, using this site to showcase my technical skills in software development and understanding of tech industry to employers, colleagues, friends or any person who has interests in my works.

Since my main interest in web is in the aspect of capturing and gaining insights from data. The overall visual design of the site has been intentionally kept simple. The design means to let the users relate to the experience of using computer terminals or calculators in 80s or early 90s before the GUI-based OS systems become the mainstream product.

## B. Functionality

The creation of main structure of the site heavily relies on flexbox (e.g navigation bar) and grid (e.g. timeline section and works section).

To make the site more visually appealing and interesting, animation effects and video background are also added.

There is dedicated grid area that serve as placeholder for all my future projects.

There is also a contact me sections linking to my gmail account where visitors can send messages to me. My social media details are also provided at the bottom.

## C. Sitemap:

Since this is a single page site, the site map is straight forward.

1. Header Section: welcome message and my name is display
2. Navigation bar: which provide quick links to other sections
3. About page: my personal introduction for the site
4. Interests: both professional and personal
5. Timeline: highly summarised version of prior experience and study
6. Skills: separated into coding and non-coding skills
7. Contact

# 2. Design Documentation

## a. Design summary

i. As a complete newbie to the web world, I have no idea about what a personal portfolio shall contain and how it shall look like in the beginning. I had some very blurry ideas in my mind but those idea never helped me settle downs to the details of design. 

To get some inspirations, I first finished reading the book The Principles of Beautiful Web Design. The most important thing I learn from it is that content shall always be the first consideration and visual/interface design is secondary to the message you try to deliver. 

Since I want to use the website to store my works in data related field and attract people with similar interests. The visual design of my site shall be simple and focus on pattern and structures. The layout and font shall look boxy and create a feeling that can be linked to calculators, typewriters and terminals that are used by hardcore scientists or engineers. For this reason, I give up the idea of recreating Chinese painting style for my website no matter how much I like it aesthetically at beginning.  

I also browsed a lot from professional portfolios created by people in the field of data visualisation. My wireframe design actually borrows a lot from those people, particularly Apolo Siskos and Hyemisong (See link at the bottom).  

In terms of the visual/graphical design, I favour the contrast feeling created by the moving pieces and their static counterpart,like the style that can be found on https://www.quantifiedplanet.org/.

Finally, green is the font color that represents the figures and data in pop culture and movies. Therefore, I choose green as my main theme color.

## b. Usability Consideration

*Visibility of system status*

a. text of navigation bar will change color when user hovers on it.
b. grid area changes style when user hovers on it.

*Aesthetic and minimalist design*

a. The design has been kept to minimal to let user focus on content (no background photos, no curved edges)

b. Contrast colour scheme (orange, green and white) are used to highlight difference and key elements.

*Recognition rather than recall*

a. navigation bar text is matched with section header, making user easily know which part they are reading.

## c. Details of planning process

## Project Plan 

The orginal plan is that I will use 10 days to create the portfolio site from scratch (including three days of studying on design books/article and research).

The actual design stage (drawing the moodboard, completing Figma) will take another three days.

Then I will take the remaining 4 days to complete all the coding jobs.

In short:

*Pre-development*

Day 1 to Day 3 Study and Research ()

*Design:* 

Day 4: Create Moodboard and collect photos and picture and logo material.
Day 5 & 6: Produce the full mock-up 

*Development:*

Day 7: Create HTML structure and put down all the text content
Day 8: Focus on responsive design: flexbox and grid
Day 9: Continues on responsive design; add colors and background pictures
Day 10: Add animation effect, video, adjusting font and fine tuning the details.

## Actual Time-line

I actually spent much more time in pre-development stage than I original planned. Even though I did use three days to finish reading the design book mentioned above, I found it very difficult to form a consistent idea on what to present and how to present. 

I end up writing a little bit of code before I actually having any moodboard or design prototype to inspire myself.

Finally, at the end of day 4, after viewing a lot of portfolio websites of others, I finally settled down to a style that can create the feel of computer terminal with a minimalist design.

This leaves me 6 days to collect material, do mock-up and write codes.

Given that situation, I decided to shorten my design stage into two day and this is the main difference between actual timeline and plan.

For actual development and code writing, I basically followed the project plan.

## Using Trello Board.

![alt text](./docs/t-board.png "trello-screen" )

Each morning, I look at my project plan and brainstorm tasks related to today's overall objective. The tasks is then entered into "to-do-list" card in Trello. When a task is finished, I moved the task to the "done" card. Form time to time, when I had some thoughts or good reference material, I add comments to the card.

## Draw graph to facilitate the responsive design and grid design

I draw graph on white board and use Microsoft excel to plan on how the layout of web will look like and how it will change when window size changes.  

## d. Future Enhancements

Animated text in top-header, navigation text and timeline header are not wrapped well in small screen. This part of responsive design shall be changed in the future.

File size of video background is too large (around 10MB) and shall be shrunk.

Contact section are is not formatted very well. The email and message box and send button needs to be redesigned.


## e. Challenges

Design, design and design! The biggest challenge for me in this project is really not that much about those technical details of writing HTML and CSS. Instead, it is all about deciding what I want to show to my audience and how I design my site aesthetically beautiful and also useful 

# 3. Short Answer Q&A

## 1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)
 
The Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) started to build the network ARPANET in 1969 in US colleges. At the inception of ARPANET, packet switching was invented to manage massive amount of simultaneous information. 

When more networks are created by different organisations at different locations, the TCP/IP is created to standardise format of packet, which allows different network talk to each other. 

When email gained its popularity in 1980s, the DNS system  were invented to handle the daunting amount of address information existing on the entire interconnected network.  

In early 90s, the US government decide end APRA project and legalise the commercial traffic and hand over the right of managing network to private organisations. @The World became the first ISP which makes money relying on infrastructure without owning actual hardware. In 1989, HTML is created and it later becomes the backbone technology of creating world wide web. 

In 2000, the commercial world witnessed the burst of the dot-com bubble but Giants like Amazon and Google survived and becomes the dominant player in today's world. 


## 2. Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domain is essentially a group of addresses of computers connected to a network/internet. Naming convention of a domain is governed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). The special thing about Domain name is that it is readable to human.

At the hardware level, DNS is underpinned by a group of dedicated computers or DNS servers. The sheer complexity of managing the address information and paths of information flow among billions of computers leads to the creation of DNS system. 

Web browser is a local software an user can use to view the web content stored in the powerful backend computer or web server.

When a user opens its browser and enters a readable URL address, the browser sends URL to a DNS server and DNS translate domain names to IP addresses and send it back to an user-end computer and so browser can load internet resources. 


## 3. Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

Cloud is the backbone of today's web technology. 
The most popular cloud product model separates cloud service into three categories: IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), and SAAS (Software-as-a-Service). Through cloud, the service (either hardware or software) can be delivered through the internet without the users actually actually owning the hardware or having the software installed in local machines. Almost every popular software people are using these days such as office, dropbox, facebook relies on cloud. 

The cloud can be traced back to 1963, when MIT was tasked with finding ways to allow two or three people accessing those gigantic, archaic computers. Virtualisation, as we call it now,makes it possible that same computer/or computers networks can be used by different people simultaneously. Late 90s saw companies like Sales forces pioneer the business model of letting user using the software on-demand by paying a subscription fee.

Amazon launched its cloud service in 2006 and now has becomes the unarguably market leader in cloud.
