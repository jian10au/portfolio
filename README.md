## 1. Key events in the development of the internet 

<!-- scihow video -->

The seminal work of Feynman in parrelled computation makes it possible for electronic engineers to covert the computers from a size that takes up the whole space of a few floors to a size that any average family can house. In 1950s to 1960s, the colleges in US start to seperate computer terminals, with circuits and tubes away from user's hands, allowing information passed from user friendly machine to a better but less accessible computer. The interwined wires along with computer is the early protypes of today's internet. The Advance Research Project Agencys, funded by US Department of Defence

## 2. Fundemental aspects of the internet: domain, web servers, DNS and web browsers

Domain is essentially a record system that keeps all address of computers connected to the internet. When you visit a website, you are visiting a group of web pages stored in that specific computer or web server that has the domain name you enter. Since the number of addresses computurs connected is as large as billions, a group of dedicated computers exists only for the purpose of keeping and update the latest domain information. You brower need to retrieve the information from domain server to understand where it can send digital packet. The software we use to veiw the text and image content is the browser
